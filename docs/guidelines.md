# Password Security Guidelines

## Common Weaknesses
- Short passwords (less than 8 characters)
- Simple patterns (e.g., "123456", "password")
- Lack of special characters or numbers

## Recommendations
1. Use at least 12 characters.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
3. Avoid common dictionary words.
4. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.

## Policy Evaluation
Password policies should enforce complexity, expiration, and history checks.
